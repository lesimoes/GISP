### About

<br/>


GISP is a project to simplify 🙏 gnome-extensions development. There're hundrends (maybe thousands?) of javascript developers, a lot of them are beginners that use gnome. I believe with build a easy enviroment for create gnome-extensions with javascript more and more new developers will join to the community and share their projects. 🥺

Warning: This is a initial version maybe there are some bugs.
